## Codebase Patterns
- Laravel 12 + Vue 3 (Inertia.js) stack
- Player model uses `fillable` array (not guarded)
- Guest players identified via session key `player_id.{CODE}`
- Host players identified via `$request->user()` (authenticated)
- Use `Illuminate\Support\Str::uuid()->toString()` for UUID generation
- PHP lint: `composer test:lint` (runs Pint), PHP tests: `composer test`
- JS lint: `npm run lint` (ESLint), JS format: `npm run format` (Prettier)
- Pre-existing test failures in BillingTest (Stripe webhook signature) — not related to game logic
- Pre-existing ESLint errors for playwright.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, e2e test files (not in tsconfig)
- Migrations use `php artisan make:migration` naming convention

## 2026-02-26 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added `reconnect_token` (nullable UUID) column to `players` table
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_26_221146_add_reconnect_token_to_players_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Player.php` (added `reconnect_token` to fillable)
  - `app/Http/Controllers/JoinController.php` (generate UUID on player creation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Player model uses a simple `$fillable` array — add new columns there
  - `JoinController::store()` is where guest players are created — any player creation logic goes here
  - The `PlayerFactory` does NOT need to include `reconnect_token` since it's nullable and defaults to null
  - There are many unrelated modified files in the working tree (Vue components) — be careful to only stage relevant files when committing
